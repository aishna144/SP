	<p>South Korea is an extraordinary country filled with beautiful beaches, thriving cities, ancient temples, remarkable natural scenery and most importantly, friendly people with ancient history. South Korea has come a long way since <i>The Korean War</i> which ended in 1953. Almost all of South Korea was completely levelled during the war which is hard to imagine if you have seen Korea recently.</p>

	<p>South Korea is home to an endless number of world class attractions and annual festivals that foreigners and locals alike enjoy each year. South Korea has something for everyone and a person could easily spend years traveling around the country exploring all that it has to offer.</p>

	<p>South Korea is one of the most law abiding countries in Asia, leaving foreigners to the country, men and women alike, feeling quite safe in rural and metropolitan areas. Koreans are interested in you but not aggressive in nature; however, one should always use caution when travelling alone in a foreign place.</p>
